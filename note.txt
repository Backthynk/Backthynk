Todo later:

1. The activity is based on time UTC (which is "ok" if your timezone is based near UTC time but at UTC+9 your today's activity won't start before 9am)
-> we compute everything in the back-end : maybe the solution would be to compute activity hour to hour. 
It will take more space in the cache but it would work for every timezone. -> we will have to make sure the entire activity is fetch once per category in the front-end -> to avoid as much as possible recomputing things 

2. Display cache overview in a cell, so users have visibility over memory consumed by the program, could be done also with CPU, and maybe traffic (analytics)
-> everything needs to be minimalistic and really simple. (data history doesn't need to be cached)

3. New readme adapted to maximum version

4. Add a feature to have an api that gives all right when added in the browser (all methods to change the state of the app.)
if the token is system is enabled and it's not entered in the cookies or somehwere then on the client side hide everything.

5. When 4 is done then add a feature to make private/public a categorie (it will be a recursive feature), if set then you can only see category's content if the token is in the cookies.
