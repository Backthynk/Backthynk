Todo now: 

1. Finish to clean the front-end code, list the last bugs and fix them.

4. Refaire le systeme de warning/error dans des fichiers qui peuvent etre consultes via une route speciale avec limit dans l'url parameters pour obtenir les N dernieres lignes

5. Ajouter un moyen simple de lancer l'application sur docker (en mode production)
max - 1. Ajouter un setup script to configure the app when starting
max . New readme adapted to current version


Todo later:

1. The activity is based on time UTC (which is "ok" if your timezone is based near UTC time but at UTC+9 your today's activity won't start before 9am)
-> we compute everything in the back-end : maybe the solution would be to compute activity hour to hour. 
It will take more space in the cache but it would work for every timezone. -> we will have to make sure the entire activity is fetch once per category in the front-end -> to avoid as much as possible recomputing things 

2. Setup zip compression for category/settings/posts/activity get methods with TTL LRU and invalidation when post is added/deleted && category is added/delete
3. Zip compression pour le index.html file avec caching

4. Setup a stats page where information about traffic/network/hardware usage, errors, warnings

5. Add a feature to have an api that gives all right when added in the browser (all methods to change the state of the app.)
if the token is system is enabled and it's not entered in the cookies or somehwere then on the client side hide everything.

6. When 4 is done then add a feature to make private/public a categorie (it will be a recursive feature), if set then you can only see category's content if the token is in the cookies.
