To fix:

1. When starting navigation through settings menu, and going back to the dashboard the app is not initialized,
you need to select a category for it while it should be direct.


Todo later:

1. Load in cache at launch time all the categories as they should never be more than a 1000 
(depending how the service is used, but for 99.9% of people) :
This should light the syntax avoiding a log of select queries + speedup categorie related search

2. The activity is based on time UTC (which is "ok" if your timezone is based near UTC time but at UTC+9 your today's activity won't start before 9am)
-> we compute everything in the back-end : maybe the solution would be to compute activity hour to hour. 
It will take more space in the cache but it would work for every timezone. -> we will have to make sure the entire activity is fetch once per category in the front-end -> to avoid as much as possible recomputing things 

3. In the confirm modal before removing a category it's currently calling all posts of the category recursirvely in order to show the files that are going to be removed.
-> Replace this feature with a route that will fetch recursively all the files url (limited to 50) of a category recursively

4. Display cache overview in a cell, so users have visibility over memory consumed by the program, could be done also with CPU, and maybe traffic (analytics)
-> everything needs to be minimalistic and really simple. (data history doesn't need to be cached)
